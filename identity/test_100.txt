JOEY: It's more
KAT: Perm?
BIANCA: Patrick -- is that- a.
KAT: It's just you.
BIANCA: Is that woman a complete fruit-loop or is it just me?
BIANCA: No! I just wanted
KAT: What? To completely damage me?  To send me to therapy forever? What?
BIANCA: I just wanted --
KAT: You set me up.
BIANCA: Let go!
KAT: So did you
BIANCA: You looked beautiful last night, you know.
BIANCA: I guess I'll never know, will I?
KAT: Not all experiences are good, Bianca. You can't always trust the people you want to.
BIANCA: God, you're just like him! Just keep me locked away in the dark, so I can't experience anything for myself
KAT: I guess I thought I was protecting you.
BIANCA: I'm not stupid enough to repeat your mistakes.
KAT: That's not
BIANCA: No. you didn't!  If you really thought I could make my own decisions, you would've let me go out with him instead of helping Daddy hold me hostage.
KAT: I wanted to let you make up your own mind about him.
BIANCA: Why didn't you tell me?
KAT: After that, I swore I'd never do anything just because "everyone else" was doing it.  And I haven't since. Except for Bogey's party, and my stunning gastro-intestinal display --
BIANCA: But
KAT: Just once.  Afterwards, I told him I didn't want to anymore.  I wasn't ready. He got pissed.  Then he broke up with me.
BIANCA: You did what?
KAT: He said everyone was doing it.  So I did it.
BIANCA: As in...
KAT: Now I do.  Back then, was a different story.
BIANCA: But you hate Joey
KAT: He was, like, a total babe
BIANCA: Why?
KAT: In 9th.  For a month
BIANCA: What?
KAT: Joey never told you we went out, did he?
BIANCA: I wish I had that luxury. I'm the only sophomore that got asked to the prom and I can't go, because you won ' t.
KAT: I do care. But I'm a firm believer in doing something for your own reasons, not someone else ' s .
BIANCA: Like you care.
KAT: Listen, I know you hate having to sit home because I'm not Susie High School.
KAT: You're welcome.
BIANCA: I don't get you.  You act like you're too good for any of this, and then you go totally apeshit when you get here.
BIANCA: I really don't think I need any social advice from you right now.
KAT: Bianca, I need to talk to you -- I need to tell you --
KAT: Can we go now?
BIANCA: You are so completely unbalanced.
BIANCA: Yeah, he's your freak friend Mandella's boyfriend.  I guess since I'm not allowed to go out, I should obsess over a dead guy, too.
KAT: It's Shakespeare.  Maybe you've heard of him?
BIANCA: Like I'm supposed to know what that even means.
KAT: At least I'm not a clouted fen- sucked hedge-pig.
BIANCA: Can't you forget for just one night that you're completely wretched?
BIANCA: Bogey Lowenstein's party is normal, but you're too busy listening to Bitches Who Need Prozac to know that.
KAT: What's normal?
BIANCA: You're ruining my life'  Because you won't be normal, I can't be normal.
BIANCA: I think you're a freak.  I think you do this to torture me.  And I think you suck.
KAT: What do you think?
BIANCA: Oh, I thought you might have a date  I don't know why I'm bothering to ask, but are you going to Bogey Lowenstein's party Saturday night?
KAT: It means that Gigglepuss is playing at Club Skunk and we're going.
BIANCA: Oh my God, does this mean you're becoming normal?
BIANCA: Can you at least start wearing a bra?
KAT: I have the potential to smack the crap out of you if you don't get out of my way.
BIANCA: Nowhere... Hi, Daddy.
KAT: Where've you been?
BIANCA: I have a date, Daddy.  And he ' s not a captain of oppression like some men we know.
WALTER: I'm missing something.
BIANCA: Fine.  I see that I'm a prisoner in my own house.  I'm not a daughter. I'm a possession!
WALTER: You're not going unless your sister goes.  End of story.
BIANCA: He's not a "hot rod".  Whatever that is.
WALTER: It's that hot rod Joey, right? That ' s who you want me to bend my rules for?
BIANCA: No, but
WALTER: The prom?  Kat has a date?
BIANCA: Daddy, I want to discuss the prom with you. It's tomorrow night --
WALTER: Because she'll scare them away.
BIANCA: Why?
WALTER: Promise me you won't talk to any boys unless your sister is present.
WALTER: Just for a minute
BIANCA: Daddy, no!
WALTER: Wear the belly before you go.
BIANCA: It's just a party. Daddy.
WALTER: Oh, God.  It's starting.
WALTER: If Kat's not going, you're not going.
BIANCA: Daddy, people expect me to be there!
BIANCA: It's just a party. Daddy, but I knew you'd forbid me to go since "Gloria Steinem" over there isn't going --
WALTER: Otherwise known as an orgy?
BIANCA: If you must know, we were attempting to go to a small study group of friends.
WALTER: And where're you going?
BIANCA: Daddy, I --
WALTER: Exactly my point
BIANCA: But she doesn't want to date.
BIANCA: But it's not fair -- she's a mutant, Daddy!
WALTER: Then neither will you.  And I'll get to sleep at night.
BIANCA: What if she never starts dating?
WALTER: No! You're not dating until your sister starts dating.  End of discussion.
BIANCA: Now don't get upset. Daddy, but there's this boy... and I think he might ask...
BRUCE: Just sent 'em through.
PATRICK: Padua girls.  One tall, decent body. The other one kinda short and undersexed?
BRUCE: Never
PATRICK: Fan of a fan.  You see a couple of minors come in?
BRUCE: Didn't have you pegged for a Gigglepuss fan.  Aren't they a little too pre-teen belly-button ring for you?
PATRICK: Always a pleasure, Brucie.
MICHAEL: Best case scenario, you're back on the payroll for awhile.
CAMERON: You humiliated the woman! Sacrifice yourself on the altar of dignity and even the score.
